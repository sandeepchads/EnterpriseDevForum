### Lets start with a situation
You recently bought a new “XYZ” smart watch on amazon and you notice that it restarts after a couple of hours. BUG!!!!
You can surely get it exchanged but wait, you are a developer and would give it a try at least. What would you do?
1.	Go through the readme and setup guide provided with the watch.
2.	Explore the troubleshooting guide in the app for the smartwatch.
3.	File a complaint in the watch website for you issue.
4.	Search for something like “XYZ model ABC restart issue” and look for a place where you would see solutions provided by folks who had faced the same problem.

Option 1, readme and guide is not really written to solve the problem you are facing. Considering Option 2, has it ever don’t anything useful for anyone. I guess not. Option3 would delay a lot. Your request might not be even entertained. Option 4 seems to be the best way to get the latest update and solutions as well if there is.

What if the issue you are facing is specific to the project you are working on, or internal to the repo or company you are working for? You cannot google it. Wikis have too much random information and might be stale. Reaching out to folks is time consuming. Mail groups are old-school. What then??

## >What is it?

* It is a portal where the employees of an organization can help each other by asking questions and providing solutions to problems which is specific to your company/division/project. Simple google search would not help out. It is a stackoverflow for your project.

## >When would I need it?

This would be the place where you could search for or ask any question you have at work. The answers would be coming from folks working around you. It is an ever-growing knowledge bank. Some sample cases could be:

* A new hire following the setup guide faced some issue. Instead of reaching out to an experience developer, it would be good to first search. Maybe it is known issue.

* Building the common repository is giving an exception. But it is works for people around. There might be some setup issue already discussed on forum.

* The framework is internal to an organization. Any question regarding its use or some issue can be freely discussed here. 

And many more…………….
